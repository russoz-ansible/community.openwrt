  conf_file:
    description:
      - Path to a custom opkg configuration file, passed to opkg as C(--conf).
      - This replaces the default opkg configuration entirely instead of adding to it, so the file must define
        its own C(dest) and C(lists_dir) entries in addition to any C(src) feed lines it needs.
      - Useful on devices where the default opkg configuration does not provide the desired feeds (for example,
        Teltonika firmware).
