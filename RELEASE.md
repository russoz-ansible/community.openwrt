# Release Process

The release process is fairly automated, but it still requires a human to check and verify the state at some checkpoints.

The process to release version `x.y.z` is as follows:

1. `nox -e release -- x.y.z` - this step also requires a release changelog fragment `changelogs/fragments/x.y.z.yml`
2. Open the PR that is generated. Wait for the tests to pass and merge.
3. After the PR is merged, wait for all the workflows in `main` to complete
4. `nox -e tag -- x.y.z`
5. Wait for Zuul to complete the release. If it fails and Zuul needs to be triggered again, use `nox -e tag -- x.y.z --retag`.
6. `nox -e github_release -- x.y.z`
7. `nox -e bump_version -- x.y.z`
8. Announce in [Ansible forum](https://forum.ansible.com) (optional)
9. Announce in Ansible Bullhorn
10. Announce in [OpenWrt forum](https://forum.openwrt.org)
11. Update [Release History](https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.openwrt/issues/100).
    Use "Ansible collection community.openwrt" in that context. See the [comments in the 1.9.0 announcement](https://forum.openwrt.org/t/release-announcement-ansible-collection-community-openwrt-1-9-0-powered-by-ucode/254234).
